- `spliddit\`: This directory contains *example* dataset files used for the experiments, originally sourced from [Spliddit.org](http://www.spliddit.org)
- `iterative_rounding.py`: Contains the core implementation of our iterative rounding algorithm for finding almost proportional allocations of goods.
- `main.py`: The main script for running the computational experiments. Executing this file will process the data in the `spliddit/` folder, run various experiments, and save the aggregated results to `result.csv`.
- `results.csv`:  The output file generated by main.py, containing the aggregated results from all experimental runs.
- `plot.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook for analyzing and visualizing the experimental results from `result.csv`. It contains the code to generate the statistics and plots discussed in the paper.
